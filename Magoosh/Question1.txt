The function doesn't work as expected as the alert is never triggered. This is
because the fadeOut function in JQuery is performed asynchronously and takes
by default 400ms to fully change from a visible to hidden status. This means
when the original function was called, the if statement would see the element
as still visible as it hadn't become fully hidden yet, and wouldn't trigger the
alert. The fixed code is attached in the question1.html file using a specified
callback function for the fadeOut.
